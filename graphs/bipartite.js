/*
  Following is a simple algorithm to find out whether a given graph is
  Bipartite or not using Breadth First Search (BFS).
  1. Assign RED color to the source vertex (putting into set U).
  2. Color all the neighbors with BLUE color (putting into set V).
  3. Color all neighborâ€™s neighbor with RED color (putting into set U).
  4. This way, assign color to all vertices such that it satisfies all the
  constraints of m way coloring problem where m = 2.
  5. While assigning colors, if we find a neighbor which is colored with same
  color as current vertex, then the graph cannot be colored with 2 vertices (or graph is not Bipartite)
